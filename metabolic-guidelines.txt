Your personalized Nutrition Plan
The Original from Europe
Thank you for choosing to participate in the Metabolic Balance nutrition program. Metabolic
Balance is a scientifically proven nutritional concept that is specific to your body and health.
It's aim is to bring your metabolism back into a healthy balance and to improve your quality
of life. When your metabolism has been adjusted, you can look forward to many of the
health benefits that accompany the program. Metabolic Balance is not a diet, but instead is a
health and well-being program as well as a way of life.
You have already taken the first step to reaching your goal by committing yourself to the
Metabolic Balance program. Together with your nutrition coach, you will be carefully guided
through the Metabolic Balance four stage program. As you go through the program you are
likely to experience: an improved quality of life, increased energy levels, deeper and more
restorative sleep, improved hormone balance and the ability to easily maintain a healthy
weight.
Your information pack contains your very own personal nutrition plan. Your individual plan
has been specially created for your body and metabolism and takes in to account your
current health alongside your blood test results. The plan includes a list of natural,
unprocessed foods that are the most suitable for your metabolism, body and well-being.
The first 14 days in the Strict Conversion Phase with Metabolic Balance are particularly
important; adhere strictly to all the recommendations in your plan. This is the only way to be
sure that you are supplying your body exclusively with those nutrients which do not put a
strain on your body and which your body really needs. This process initiates the regulation of
your metabolism
the supreme goal and unique feature of our entire nutrition program.
Your insulin secretion is returned to normal levels; this has a positive effect on all other body
processes and, as a result, your well-being and your weight. And entirely without the yo-yo
effect!
These early 14 days are also extremely important in allowing your body a chance to adapt to
its new lifestyle. It is a chance to let go of any unhealthy habits or attitudes towards food and
replace them with healthier ones. You will learn to become familiar with your
inner
hunger signals and will be able to identify the foods your body really needs.
After just two weeks you will already be able to look back proudly at all that you have
achieved. With your increased knowledge of nutrition, coupled with your own personal
experience, your health is likely to take on a whole new meaning. We would like to wish you
every success on your nutritional journey.

Important Note:
Try to spend a few minutes outside, several times during the day, to refresh your mind
and body. Correct breathing supports detoxification. Therefore consciously aim to take
deep breaths several times a day.
How to check that your plan is genuine.
Unfortunately we have seen a recent increase in the number of counterfeit
Metabolic Balance nutrition plans. Imitation nutrition plans do not take your
personal health information into account nor your laboratory values in the
same way that a genuine Metabolic Balance plan can. At worst, a forged
trition plan could lead to deterioration in your health. To validate that your
plan is genuine please visit the web site below and enter the confirmation

Important
note
specifically
for
this
case:
Please
look
after
your
personal
plan.

only
able
to
store
data
for
years,
in
accordance
with
current
data

regulations.
Therefore,
if
you
lose
your
plan,
you
should
talk
directly
to
your

they
work
in.
Phase 1: Preparation Phase
Metabolic Balance - The individual Phases
During
the
2-
day
Preparation
Phase
your
body
is
gently
prepared
for
the
nutritional
transformation.
In
order
not
to

any
cravings
later,
a
thorough
digestive
cleanse
is
necessary.
During
those
first
two
days
of
the
Metabolic
Balance
program
only
light
food
is
suggested,
so
your
body
is
primed
for
the
nutritional
adjustment.
IMPORTANT:
On
the
first
day
of
the
Preparation
Phase,
we
recommend
a
thorough
ing
of
the
gut.
Your
coach
can
suggest
a
suitable
product
or
even
a
more
gentle
method
(e.g.
magnesium
citrate,
psyllium
husk),
enema
or
colon
drotherapy.
Valid
for
both
days
of
the

vegetables or rice.
You can enjoy the vegetables raw, steamed or cooked, or even drink puréed in a smoothie.
Please cook rice and potatoes in clear water. You may use spices, but no butter or oil.
Unsweetened apple sauce goes well with the rice (2 TBsp per servings, w/o sugar or
flavoring).
You do not need to eat the full portion if you are sated with a smaller amount than stated
below (applies only in Phase 1).
All measurements refer to the raw weight.

The 8 Rules
Metabolic Balance
Eat exactly three meals a day.
ing the Strict Conversion Phase you
must follow the plan to the letter: do
not eat more, do not eat less and do
not eat anything other than what is
included in your personal food list.
Eat only one type of protein per
meal. For each of your three meals
choose a protein from a different
protein group, so that you are eating
three different protein groups every
day.
After each meal, take a break of at
least five hours before beginning
your next meal.
If possible, don't eat after 9 pm.
Do not allow any single meal to last
longer than 60 minutes.
Over the course of the day, drink at
least the amount of water calculated
for you. (Rule of thumb: in general 35
ml of water per kg of body weight.)
Begin each meal with one or two
bites of your protein portion.
Eat an apple every day with a meal
or as a dessert.
Phase 2: Strict Conversion Phase
Metabolic Balance - The individual Phases
Welcome
to
Phase
2,
the
Strict
Conversion
Phase.
You
stay
in
Phase
until
you
have
reached
your
goal
or
for
a
minimum
of
days.
From
the
beginning
of
Phase
the
Rules
apply.
Please
be
very
particular
in
the
first
days
and
use
only
items
from
your
personal
food
list
in
the
amounts
indicated.
Please
do
not
cook
with
any
oil
or
fats
during
the
first
two
weeks.
To
prepare
your
meals
use
non-
stick
pans,
aluminum
foil,
clay
or
steam
pots
or
even
a
contact
grill.
Use
just
plain
water
or
a
vegetable
broth
without
sugar
or
other
additives
to
simmer
your
food.
IMPORTANT:
If
you
stay
longer
in
the
Strict
Conversion
Phase,
after
days
please
add
healthy,
cold-
pressed
oils
to
supplement
your
meals.
We
recommend
at
least
three
dessertspoons(30ml)
of
healthy
oil
per
day
in
the
form
of
a
balanced
'blend'
of
omega-3
and
omega-6
fatty
acids.
Alternatively,
you
may
use
a
good
quality
cold-
pressed
flax
or
linseed
oil
which
is
high
in
omega-3
fatty
acids.
Your
coach
can
mend
healthy
oils
to
you.
From
now
on
your
meal
plan
will
act
as
a
framework
in
which
you
can
include
foods
from
your
personal
food
list.
To
maintain
variety
in
your
diet,
and
to
ensure
that
you
are
receiving
all
the
nutrients
your
body
requires,
it
is
important
to
include
as
many
different
foods
as
possible
from
your
personal
food
list.
Please
also
take
note
of
the
Additional
Information
which
is
given
after
your
food
list.
You
will
also
find
recipe
suggestions
and
ideas
to
help
you
with
the
first
days
of
the
Strict
Phase.
In
addition,
your
coach
will
be
able
to
provide
you
with
recipes
that
comply
with
the
Metabolic
Balance
principles.
Usually
you
would
follow
your
plan's
suggestions
for
breakfast,
lunch
and
dinner.
In
the
strict
phase,
please
follow
your
breakfast
suggestions
exactly
as
they
are.
It's
important
to
note
that
eggs
may
only
be
eaten
for
breakfast
if
they
are
suggested
as
a
breakfast
for
you.
You
may;
however,
swap
your
lunch
and
dinner
suggestions.
If
you
do
this
you
must
remember
that
different
quantities
will
now
apply.
When
lunch
is
swapped
for
dinner,
please
add
grams
more
to
both
the
protein
and
the
vegetables/
salad.
If
you
choose
to
swap
your
dinner
suggestion
for
lunch,
you
must
decrease
the
amount
by
10g.
For
example,
if
there
is
currently
g
of
fish
for
lunch
and
g
cheese
for
dinner,
you
would
instead
eat
g
of
cheese
for
lunch
and
g
of
fish
for
dinner.
Please
also
remember
that
you
need
to
add
or
subtract
10g
to
the
amount
of
vegetables
or
salad.
During
Phase
2,
your
metabolism
will
adapt
to
it's
optimal
nutrition,
allowing
you
to
mentally
adjust
to
your
new
way
of
life.
It
is
important
to
focus
on
yourself
during
this
time
whilst
becoming
aware
of
your
body's
natural
signals.
Try
to
be
aware
of
any
changes
you
experience
during
this
time
and
enjoy
the
feeling
that
you
are
replacing
old
and
unhealthy
food
habits
for
newer,
healthier
ones.

$
Phase 2: Strict Conversion Phase
We
hope
that
during
this
time
you
will
be
able
to
embrace
your
new
lifestyle.
Eat
mindfully
during
this
time
and
enjoy
eating
the
foods
that
are
best
suited
to
your
body.
Although
there
are
a
few
limitations,
Metabolic
Balance
focuses
on
the
abundance
of
foods
from
which
you
can
choose
rather
than
focusing
on
any
restrictions.
On
account
of
Metabolic
Balance
you
might
even
discover
new
foods
or
alternative
cooking
methods
that
you
haven't
tried
before.
Not
only
will
you
be
enjoying
new
and
exciting
foods;
but
you
will
also
notice
that
you
remain
comfortably
full
between
your
meals.
Please
note
that
physical
or
emotional
stress
can
also
have
a
negative
impact
on
your
will-
power.
You
can
replace
physical
activity
during
this
time
by
spending
more
time
on
yourself
and
allowing
yourself
time
to
relax.
This
will
help
to
give
your
body
the
rest
it
needs
to
reset!
To
avoid
becoming
dissuaded
or
distracted
from
your
goal,
it
might
be
necessary
to
avoid
tempting
situations,
such
as
family
gatherings
or
dinner
invitations
during
the
day
Strict
Phase.
In
addition,
it
might
be
necessary
to
pay
attention
to
the
people
with
whom
you
surround
yourself.
Are
you
receiving
support
from
your
family
and
friends
or
do
you
feel
that
someone
is
trying
to
"meddle"
with
your
success?
It
may
be
necessary
to
talk
directly
to
anyone
who
might
sabotage
your
success
or
just
give
them
a
wide
berth!
After
the
first
two
weeks
on
the
Strict
Adjustment
Phase,
you
can
now
begin
to
add
exercise
into
your
plan.
Incorporate
physical
activity
into
your
daily
routine
in
order
to
get
your
metabolism
going
and
to
enjoy
your
new-
found
energy.
If
you
remain
on
the
Strict
Adjustment
Phase
for
more
than
days,
consult
with
your
coach
to
find
out
the
best
ways
for
you
to
successfully
incorporate
exercise
into
your
Metabolic
Balance
plan.
Keeping
a
personal
diary
can
help
you
to
keep
track
of
any
improvements.
This
can
be
done
in
addition
to
the
plan's
progress
report,
where
you
record
all
your
physical
and
mental
results.
You
might
find
it
helpful
to
make
notes
every
day
while
reflecting
upon
the
following
two
questions:
What
was
important
today?
What
went
well
today?
forget
to
praise
yourself
regularly
for
both
your
success
and
your
effort.
No
matter
how
small,
each
small
positive
change
is
a
big
success.
After
you
have
completed
days
on
the
strict
adaptation
phase,
you
can
indulge
yourself
once
a
week
with
a
meal.
Enjoying
the
occasional
indulgence
is
actually
good
for
you
as
it
helps
to
curb
cravings,
which
could
in
turn
jeopardise
your
plan.
If
you
feel
in
the
mood
for
a
piece
of
dark
chocolate
or
even
something
more
substantial,
you
should
eat
it
mindfully
and
really
enjoy
it!
If
there
is
an
occasion
such
as
a
holiday
or
a
family
event,
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
enjoying
a
providing
that
you
have
successfully
completed
the
first
days
of
the
Strict
Phase.
Refer
to
the
information
about
"treat
meals"
in
the
Phase
instructions.
Enjoy
your
new
eating
habits:
Slow,
enjoyable,
deliberate.
You
will
be
surprised
how
effectively
your
Metabolic
ance
plan
supports
your
goals
and
strengthens
your
will
to
succeed!
Phase 2: Strict Conversion Phase
Additional Information about the Nutrition Plan
Water
We recommend that you drink 3 litres of water, which has been calculated
individually for you. This supports the excretion of break-down products and
thereby speeds up metabolic adjustment.
Vegetables
We suggest that you enjoy your vegetables al dente (firm to the bite) or raw
(depending on the kind of vegetable you are using). You may also use
additive-free frozen vegetables. You are welcome to combine different
vegetables and even swap vegetables for salad depending on your personal
preference and the seasonal availability.
Herbs and Spices
Use fresh or pure dried herbs, fresh garlic, chilli, ginger, black pepper,
turmeric, cinnamon, mustard and pure curry powders in moderate quantities
to flavour your meals. Use one teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar or
balsamic vinegar for salad dressing, but no oil.
Bread
Do not to exceed your limit of rye bread per day. A slice of whole-grain
sourdough rye bread (25 g) equates nutritionally to a slice of rye crispbread
(10 g). If you like, you can alternate both types of bread. Bread is however
optional and you do not need to eat bread if you don't want to.
Fruits
Eat a medium-sized, tart apple every day.In addition to your apple, you may
eat one other type of fruit from your fruit list with one of your meals.If
possible, please choose older varieties of apples such as Granny Smith,
Jonathan or Gold/Red Delicious. If the fruits in your personal food list are
currently not available fresh, you can buy them frozen. Do not use canned
fruit!
Coffee and Tea
You may treat yourself to up to three normal-sized cups of coffee and / or
up to three cups of black, green, white or rooibos tea daily. Please drink tea
or coffee only at mealtimes and avoid adding any milk, sugar or artificial
sweeteners. We do not recommend drinking flavoured teas or coffees.
Alcohol, Soft
Drinks and Fruit
Juices
In the Strict Adjustment Phase: alcohol, soft drinks, and fruit juices are not
allowed.
Phase 2: Strict Conversion Phase
Vitamins
Please be aware that your body may have increased nutrient requirements
during it's nutritional adjustment. Since vitamins are lost during cooking, it is
useful not to cook all of your fruits and vegetables. If possible, eat some fruit
and vegetables raw or lightly steamed. Please consult with your coach as to
whether a multivitamin and / or mineral supplement is advisable for you.
Please consider:
Remember, this meal plan has been created exclusively for you based on your
sonal information and your lab values. Other individuals will most likely not achieve the
desired effects when using this plan and, at worst, a deterioration of their health could
occur because your plan may lack essential food items suitable for them. A random
weight gain or loss may occur for such individuals using your plan: a targeted and
mized metabolism regulation can only be achieved through individualized lab-based
nutrition plans.
Phase 2: Strict Conversion Phase
Expert tips for everyday life!
Metabolic Balance in day-to-day life
The amounts given in the meal plan indicate the raw weight of the food. If you are using
cooked beans or lentils, please double the amount stated. If using frozen fruits and
vegetables use the same amount as fresh. Frozen meat, poultry or fish should be
thawed before weighing. Add 25 g to the weight of frozen meat, poultry, or fish to
compensate for the water lost during thawing.
The daily examples on your plan are only suggestions. You can, of course, prepare all
meals to your liking as long as you follow the 8 rules.
Since you are drinking a lot of water, you should also add salt in normal quantities to
supply your body with valuable minerals. Please only use unrefined salt without
additives, for example: sea-, himalayan- or rock salt.
In order to add more flavour and variety to your dishes, you can exchange the
vegetables/salad ingredients that are given in your recipes. For example, you may
substitute 10 g onions for 10 g spinach in a recipe providing they are included on your
personal food list.
You may use fresh or dried herbs and spices (additive- and sugar-free) in moderate
amounts to add flavour to your food. Remember that the appearance of your food also
affects the taste. Setting the table and making your food look appealing are all part of
the eating process.
Do you have a favourite restaurant? If so, talk to the chef about how (s)he can help you
to stick to your food plan when you eat there.
With Metabolic Balance your daily routine can still remain flexible and stress-free by
preparing meals at home and taking them with you.
easy to prepare a delicious
breakfast or lunch in the evening in preparation for the following day.
IMPORTANT:
Remember, this meal plan has been created exclusively for you based on your
sonal information and your lab values. Other individuals will most likely not achieve the
desired effects when using this plan and, at worst, a deterioration of their health could
occur because your plan does not include food items suitable for them.
Phase 2: Strict Conversion Phase
The basic principles behind the 8 Rules
Metabolic Balance
Eat
exactly
three
meals
a
day,
each
lasting
a
maximum
of
one
hour.
After
the
end
of
a
meal
and
before
the
beginning
of
the
next
meal,
you
should
take
a
break
of
at
least
five
hours
(maximum
seven).
Ideally,
extend
the
overnight
break
between
your
evening
meal
and
breakfast
the
next
day
to
hours
(twice
weekly).
During
the
five-
hour
breaks
between
meals
and
especially
during
the
night,
insulin
falls
to
very
low
levels.
This
enables
fat
to
be
burned
easily.
When
you
have
five
or
six
smaller
meals,
or
when
you
snack
between
meals,
the
insulin
level
remains
constantly
high
which
means
your
body
will
make
more
fat
rather
than
build
muscle
tissue!
Also,
continually
high
insulin
levels
block
the
production
of
many
hormones
that
protect
the
body
from
inflammation
and
ageing!
Begin
each
meal
with
one
or
two
bites
of
your
protein
portion
to
steadily
regulate
your
insulin
level.
When
the
stomach
receives

or
two
bites
of
protein
first,
the
pancreas
produces
the
hormone
glucagon,
to
help
digest
the
protein.
This
hormone
is
the
antagonist
of
insulin
and
blocks
insulin
production.
The
result
is
a
lower
initial
insulin
release
which
supports
fat
burning,
blocks
fat
synthesis,
and
prevents
the
dreaded
attacks
of
ravenous
appetite.
In
your
meal
plan
and
the
daily
examples
you
will
find
the
protein
(e.g.
pulses,
fish
or
cheese)
listed
first
so
it's
easy
to
work
out
what
is
the
protein
in
your
meal.
Phase 2: Strict Conversion Phase
Eat
only
one
type
of
protein
per
meal.
For
each
of
your
three
meals
choose
a
protein
from
a
different
protein
group
so
that
you
are
eating
three
different
protein
groups
every
day.
In
the
digestive
tract
our
bodies
use
enzymes
to
break
down
the
ingested
proteins
into
individual
amino
acids.
These
are
absorbed
through
the
intestinal
wall,
where
they
are
reassembled
into
human
proteins.
The
critical
factor
for
our
metabolism
is
not
determined
by
the
overall
quantity
of
proteins
consumed,
but
rather
by
the
spectrum
of
amino
acids
they
contain.
The
eight
essential
amino
acids
are
particularly
important
as
they
cannot
be
synthesised
by
the
body
and
therefore
need
to
be
ingested
as
food.
The
more
a
protein
resembles
human
proteins,
the
higher
its
biological
value.
This
means;
how
much
of
a
food
protein
can
be
converted
into
human
protein.
The
usefulness
of
a
protein
is
actually
decided
by
the
amino
acid
which
is
present
in
the
smallest
quantity.
When
different
protein
foods
are
combined,
the
Biological
Value
is
determined
by
the
amino
acid
whose
overall
proportion
is
lowest.
Above
this
level,
all
other
unused
amino
acids
will
become
waste
products
in
the
body
which
can
lead
to
increased
acidity.
The
ideal
amino
acid
ratio
is
found
in
egg
yolk,
in
which
100%
of
the
eight
essential
amino
acids
can
be
converted
into
human
protein.
Therefore,
egg
yolk
has
a
Biological
Value
of
100.
In
contrast,
milk
contains
only
91%
of
the
essential
amino
acid
threonine.
This
means
that
only
91%
of
the
other
essential
amino
acids
can
also
be
used,
giving
milk
a
Biological
Value
of
91.
Combining
proteins
is
therefore
not
recommended
as
this
can
actually
lower
their
overall
Biological
Value.
Metabolic
Balance
uses
primarily
proteins
with
a
high
biological
value
(above
70)
and
recommends
eating
only
one
type
of
protein
at
each
meal.
Otherwise,
it
is
possible
that
the
biological
value
will
be
reduced,
resulting
in
over-
acidification
of
the
body.
If
you
drink
less
than
the
amount
of
water
stipulated
in
your
individual
plan
(the
rule
of
thumb
is
a
minimum
of
ml
of
water
per
kilogram
of
body
weight),
then
you
will
lose
weight
more
slowly.
Water
cleanses
the
body
and
helps
wash
out
the
residues
and
toxins
Phase 2: Strict Conversion Phase
resulting
from
tissue
breakdown.
If
you
drink
too
little,
these
substances
remain
in
the
body.
It
is
best
to
drink
water
before
you
feel
thirsty
and
to
divide
the
beverages
throughout
the
day.
Particularly
suitable
is
water
that
is
not
carbonated.
Coffee
and
black
tea,
green
tea,
white
tea,
or
rooibos
tea
is
only
permitted
with
meals.
An
old
proverb
says:
apple
a
day
keeps
the
doctor
No
other
fruit
can
compare
to
the
vitamins
and
minerals
in
the
cholesterol
and
uric
acid
lowering
apple!
In
addition,
apples
provide
the
body
with
valuable
fibre,
since
they
are
high
in
pectin
and
cellulose
content.
Apples
are
important
for
the
speedier
excretion
of
harmful
metabolic
waste
products.
Old
apple
varieties
are
especially
rich
in
polyphenols,
which
actively
counteract
free
radicals.
Moreover,
fruit
in
general
provides
the
body
with
many
important
minerals,
dietary
fibre,
vitamins,
and
trace
elements.
Finally,
fruits
are
simply
a
pleasure
to
eat.

Treat Meals
Metabolic Balance
You
should
mindfully
enjoy
a
treat
meal
from
time
to
time.
Especially
when
celebrating
a
special
event
like
a
family
reunion:
eat
what
you
want
and
feel
guilty!
Make
sure
to
listen
to
the
signals
and
reactions
of
your
body
and
ensure
to
adhere
to
the
Treat
Meal
Guidelines
(see
next
page)
to
enjoy
this
delicious
meal.
Pay
attention
to
your
body's
revitalized
signals,
your
intensified
sense
of
smell
and
taste,
your
real
feeling
of
fullness,
or
simply
your
dislike
of
former
favorite
foods.
Although
you
might
have
dreamt
of
enjoying
your
favourite
foods
again,
your
tastes
will
have
changed
and
you
might
find
that
you
no
longer
enjoy
those
foods
as
before.
Please
take
your
body's
messages
seriously,
and
have
the
courage
to
stop
eating!
Your
well
being
is
the
most
important
thing.
If

with
the
changes
that
have
occurred

The 8 Guidelines for Treat Meals
Metabolic Balance
Tip 1:
You may enjoy a treat meal once a week. As always start your treat
meal with a little protein.
Tip 2:
Drink extra water before and after a treat meal.
Tip 3:
If the meal lasts longer than one hour, please take a break of at least 15
minutes between courses, during which you may only drink water. Then
continue your meal again with a bite of protein.
Tip 4:
If you are eating out, take a few nuts or some cheese with you - so that
Tip 5:
For the remaining two meals that day, omit fruit and additional starchy
products, like bread.
Tip 6:
Avoid rich, heavy sauces and carbohydrate-rich side dishes.
Tip 7:
If you enjoy chocolate; always opt for a minimum of 70 % cocoa content,
eat only a small amount and really savour the taste.
Tip 8:
Limit your consumption of alcoholic drinks and remember to drink
plenty of water alongside any alcohol.
Phase 3: Relaxed Conversion Phase
Metabolic Balance - The individual Phases
Congratulations - you have reached a major milestone!
After consulting with your coach you can now enter Phase 3 of your plan. When entering the
Relaxed Adjustment Phase, you should be able to look back proudly at all that you have
achieved. You should now have reached your desired weight and/or seen a noticeable
improvement to your health. It may be that you have entered Phase 3 in order to enjoy a
one-off meal or event. If this is the case, you should stay on Phase 3 for this event, before
returning to Phase 2 again. Remember to follow the 8 rules and the extra guidelines for treat
meals. In phase 3 your food lists have also been extended. In addition, you may also wish to
bring in new foods that are not currently on your personal food list in order to see
how well you tolerate them. Whilst doing this, always remember that your goal is to keep
your newly adjusted metabolism in balance. The 8 Rules ALL still apply and remain
unchanged, although you may now enjoy the occasional treat meal.
In the more relaxed Phase 3, you will discover how much food you are able to eat before
you start to feel full. You may also carefully experiment with slightly different foods or
quantities that were not on your Phase 2 plan. Use the new items on your Phase 3 food list
alongside your meal plan to help you organise your meals. Remember to still listen to your
inner signals which are there to help you. You may also wish to try some of your
former favourite foods again that are were not on your personal food list. Please remember
though, to stay true to the principles of your plan and to only make changes one at a time.
Gradually introduce your body to larger amounts of carbohydrate. First, start at lunch by
adding carbohydrate such as whole grain pasta, wild rice or potatoes. Please remember
not to eat any additional bread at this meal. You may; however, still use your allocated
bread allowance to supplement other meals.
Increase the amount of food you consume at lunch by 10 g every week (5g carbohydrate
+
5g protein). Carefully observe your hunger and satiety during this time, until you reach
a carbohydrate portion that is suitable for you. Please increase the amount of
carbohydrates and protein equally. On no account should you increase the amount of
carbohydrate you are eating whilst at the same time reducing the amount of protein.
This would result in you feeling hungry and would increase your overall insulin secretion.
Continue to weigh yourself and regularly measure your waist. Enjoy having a healthy
weight that is now easy to maintain, even though you occasionally indulge yourself.
It is a good idea to measure your progress with some of your old clothes. Try slipping
them to see how they feel.
Now that you have tried several new things, you may wish to note some of them down in
a diary. In particular, you may wish to note how they made you feel, and how they
affected your weight.
Observe carefully how your body reacts to any changes. If you have added variation to your
plan which has led to negative symptoms, try to correlate the symptoms with the changes
that you have made. Try going back to Strict Adjustment Phase for a few days or if you are
unsure, discuss your experiences with your coach.
$$CA\PHASE3$$
Phase 4: Maintenance Phase
Metabolic Balance - The individual Phases
Congratulations - you did it!
Congratulate yourself on your success, you have balanced your metabolism, thereby
successfully reached your target weight, improved your health and well-being! You are
doing well, you feel fit, lean, powerful and comfortable in your body. But most importantly,
you have proven that you made the right decision! With your willpower and your stamina
you can reach other ambitious goals. You can be proud of yourself!
The idea of Phase 4 is to maintain your success long term. So please, do not fall back into
your old habits after adjusting so successfully to the principles of Metabolic Balance!
As already mentioned above: Metabolic Balance is not a diet
Metabolic Balance is a
lifestyle! Therefore, the 8 Rules will continue to apply, especially in your day-to-day life. In
addition:
Continue to exercise every day. This can even be achieved on workdays; take the stairs
instead of using the elevator; walk or ride a bicycle instead of taking the car or the bus;
get off the bus one stop before or after your actual destination and walk the remaining
distance; park at the far end of the parking lot rather than close to the doors and try to
regularly go swimming or walking
alone or with friends.
Make sure to engage in physical activity at least two to three times per week. The
regular activity ensures your weight maintenance and optimizes your health!
Take a 15-minute break after one hour when attending long meals. Begin the next
course with a bite of protein again.
Continue to choose your food mindfully whilst following your newly learned way of eating
and enjoy each and every meal. Be prepared for some surprises though; Metabolic Balance
meals can offer some real taste sensations! With a heightened sense of smell and taste and
a better understanding of what your body really needs, eating should become a really
enjoyable experience.
Now that the 8 Rules have become second nature to you, you should find it easy to maintain
your new weight and your well-being. You can now enjoy every type of celebration or
invitation, because your new lifestyle allows you to fit in without being an outsider. On the
contrary, you have become the nutrition expert. People may have started asking you
questions about the obvious changes that you have made. But these changes
just
happen over-night, you reached your goal by being disciplined and consistent. Please enjoy
the compliments, offer tips where you can, but most importantly stay true to yourself and
your newly acquired knowledge.
Be conscious about eating only moderate amounts of carbohydrate, primarily with a low
Glycaemic Load (GL). Wherever possible continue to eat food from your personal list. Please,
also remember to maintain your new exercise routine everyday. This way, the yo-yo effect
have a chance!
$$CA\PHASE4$$
Phase 4: Maintenance Phase
Please,
always
remember:
The
better
you
adhere
to

Rules,
the
easier
you

weight.
We
wish
you
every
success!
